# Issue: Compatibility Problem with NumPy 2.0.0 and torch

## 1. Existing Problem
When importing the `torch` module alongside NumPy 2.0.0, there is a compatibility issue that results in a failure to properly initialize NumPy, leading to potential crashes. The problem arises because modules compiled with NumPy 1.x are not compatible with NumPy 2.0.0. This discrepancy requires that modules need to be recompiled using NumPy 2.0.0, or some may need to be rebuilt using specific dependencies like `pybind11>=2.12`.

Here's a summary of the error received when attempting to run torch with NumPy 2.0.0:

```bash
A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.0.0 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.

    return _bootstrap._gcd_import(name[level:], package, level)
AttributeError: _ARRAY_API not found
```


## 2. Possible Solutions
### 2.1. Downgrade NumPy
The immediate workaround to avoid this compatibility issue is to downgrade NumPy to a version lower than 2.0.0. This can be achieved by running:

```bash
pip install "numpy<2"
```

This solution ensures compatibility but at the cost of not being able to use the latest features of NumPy.

### 2.2. Rebuild Affected Modules
Another solution is to rebuild the affected modules with `pybind11>=2.12` to ensure compatibility with NumPy 2.0.0. This is especially necessary for modules that are tightly coupled with NumPy's C API.

### 2.3. Upgrade Affected Modules
Regularly check for updates from the module maintainers who may release versions compatible with NumPy 2.0.0. Upgrading these modules as updates become available can help in transitioning to the new NumPy version smoothly.

## 3. Request for Assistance
We are looking for contributions and suggestions on how to handle this transition more effectively, especially in ensuring that all dependent modules can smoothly upgrade to NumPy 2.0.0 without significant downtime or functionality loss. Any community insights or patches are highly appreciated!
